Understanding Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript:
JavaScript, a versatile and widely-used programming language, is built around the concept of objects. Objects in JavaScript are fundamental to both organizing data and structuring code.

What are Objects in JavaScript?
Object is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys (also known as properties) are strings or symbols, and the values can be any type, including other objects, functions, arrays, or primitive data types.

Syntax:
let Objectname = {
  Key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  .
  .
  .
  .
  key(n): value(n)
}
